The DNS::ZoneFile package
=========================

DNS::ZoneFile - a tool to manipulate DNS zone files
DNS::ZoneFile::Record - a object model for the individual records
                  in a zone.

Both are written by and are (c) Copyright Matthew Byng-Maddick

Bug reports and, if you like, fixes should be sent here, and I'll try
to include them in the official distribution.

The authoritative source for this is at http://colondot.net/japh/DNSZone/

You are free to use, distribute and modify this as you like, but an
indication of the original author must be included.

I would also like to be kept abreast of the modifications that are made
to ZoneFile.pm and ZoneFile/Record.pm, but that's just because I'm
curious to know what I've done wrong.

The standard way to build this package is

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
