The DNSZone package
===================

DNSZone - a tool to manipulate DNS zone files
DNSZone::Record - a object model for the individual records
                  in a zone.

Both are written by and are (c) Copyright Matthew Byng-Maddick

You are free to use, distribute and modify this as you like, but an
indication of the original author must be included.

I would also like to be kept abreast of the modifications that are made
to DNSZone.pm and DNSZone/Record.pm

The standard way to build this package is

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Although, at present there are no tests, these will come in a future
distribution of the package.
